# Sports Registration and Approval Mini-Program

## Overview

Developed in collaboration with the Sports Center at Southern University of Science and Technology, this project aimed to create a comprehensive solution for internal sports event registrations and approvals through a WeChat mini-program and a backend management system. Initiated in the spring of 2023, the project received unanimous acclaim for its innovation and utility. However, due to the departure of two team members from the department, who chose to change their major for a better learning environment, the project was unfortunately shelved at the point of deploying.

As I plan to organize and open-source the mini-program component, it is my hope that this will be beneficial to others in similar endeavors.

I have uploaded some extended information in the file "INTRODUCTION", including a System Requirement Specification (SyRS) and two presentation video of different user's ends.

Hope you like this project, and considering to give us a Star🌟~

## Reflection

In finalizing the documentation for this project on GitHub, I reflect on its journey - a project conceived with passion but concluded prematurely. The departure of my teammates, who bravely changed their academic paths in pursuit of new horizons, marks both an end and a new beginning.
